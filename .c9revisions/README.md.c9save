Clone the repository\n2. Run something like `virtualenv.py env` to create a new virtual environment in the repo\n\t* I'd recommend naming it `env` since this is in the `.gitignore` file\n\t* This will also install pip in the environment, which is nice\n3. Now activate the virtual environment using `source env/bin/activate`\n4. Install all of the dependencies for the app using `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n5. You can now (hopefully) run `python manage.py runserver` to test the app\n6. If you have [foreman](http://theforeman.org) installed, you can run `foreman start` to test the production server ([gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org))"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":831}]],"length":831}
