# FixThis
*We're making the world a better place here.*

## Requirements
* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for local development
* [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) for cloud development

## Set up/Installation
### Local development
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure MAMP/WAMP with the directory
3. Run it!

### Cloud development
1. Configure Heroku on your machine
2. Ask me to add you as a collaborator if you aren't already
3. I'm not sure, but I think you need to add the heroku git repos to your remote list on your local repo
